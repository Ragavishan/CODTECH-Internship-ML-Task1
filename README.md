# Overview of the Project
## Project Title : Linear Regression on Housing Prices
### Objective
To implement linear regression to predict housing prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
### Dataset
Simulated dataset with features representing square footage, number of bedrooms, and a categorical variable for location.
Target variable: Housing Price.
### Key Activities
The dataset consists of the following columns:

1.Generate or simulate a dataset with relevant features and target variables.


2. Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.


3. Train a linear regression model using scikit-learn.


4. Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.


5. Visualize the model’s predictions versus actual values using a scatter plot.
